## Who Am I?
I am a software developer fresh out of college and currently striving to expand my skillset to become a full fledge software engineer. I obtained my bachelor's degree<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> at Louisiana State University in 2017 and went straight into working in IBM as a software developer. I enjoy working with code and spend a large amount of my personal time playing video games and reading mangas & light novels.
